# Manage My  Tree

Plugin allows for:
* moving pages (drag-n-drop)
* renaming them (double-click or "Rename" button)
* creating new pages ("Create" button)
* removing unused pages ("Remove" button)

Every change is performed on a copy of the page tree in memory. You can do any number of changes (adding, removing, renaming, and moving) on this tree before committing your work.

## Installation

1. Log in to Confluence as administrator.
2. Install [MMT Plugin](https://marketplace.atlassian.com) via Atlassian Marketplace.
